# Nashville Housing Project - Data Cleaning and Transformation

## Overview

This project showcases my expertise in data cleaning using SQL and transforming raw data into a format suitable for advanced analytics. The focus is on a Nashville housing dataset, and the subsequent sections outline the key aspects of this undertaking.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Cleaning using SQL:**
   - Employ SQL queries to clean and preprocess the raw housing data.
   - Address missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers in the dataset.

2. **Transforming Data for Advanced Analytics:**
   - Utilize SQL transformations to reshape and structure the data for advanced analytical tasks.
   - Aggregate and join tables to provide a comprehensive view of the Nashville housing market.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning with SQL

The initial phase involves rigorous data cleaning using SQL. Techniques applied include:
   - Handling missing values through imputation or removal.
   - Standardizing data formats to ensure consistency.
   - Identifying and addressing outliers that may affect the quality of analytics.

### 2. Transformation for Analytics

The transformed data is prepared for advanced analytics by:
   - Aggregating housing data to extract meaningful insights.
   - Employing SQL joins to integrate relevant information from multiple tables.
   - Creating derived features that enhance the analytical capabilities of the dataset.


## Analysis Results

Upon completion, the cleaned and transformed dataset is ready for advanced analytics, providing a solid foundation for further exploration, modeling, and insights generation.
